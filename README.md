# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a custom and interactive webpage that showcases different UFO sightings around the world. 

## Results
With this new webpage we have added 4 additional search criteria: city, state, country, and shape. To navigate this, the user can enter in one or more of the criteria to filter the results. For example, if you wanted to search for UFO sightings in California you would just need to enter "ca" into the state search results.
